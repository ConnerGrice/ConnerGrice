### Hi, I'm Conner

I am an amateur (unoffical) Software developer and Data Scientist trying to extend my knowledge on everything that is data and computing. My offical education is in Theoretical Physics, where I acheived a BSc.  

## Current Doings

Project|Description
-------|-----------
[Geant4-Obsidian-Learning-Resource](https://github.com/ConnerGrice/Geant4-Obsidian-Learning-Resource)| This is a collection of notes I have taken during my research into the Geant4 Simulation framework. It is still a WIP and it not comprehensive, However, I think it covers the absolute basics of a standard Geant4 program with some simple examples included. It is best viewed using Obsidian from the Canvas file Geant4-Overview.canvas.

## Current Dones

Project|Description
---|---
[Spotify-Extractor](https://github.com/ConnerGrice/Spotify-Extractor)|A Python system that can fetch all of the users Spotify playlist data, create a database, then use that database to plot a few diagrams visualising what type of songs the user has saved. The main libraries used in the program are, Spotipy, in order to communicate with the official Spotify API, SQLite3 is used to generate and fill a local database, and Bokeh, a browser based visualisation library for generating the diagrams.
[Hyperion-Capstone-Projects](https://github.com/ConnerGrice/Hyperion-Capstone-Projects)|A collection of projects completed during my Hyperion Development Data Science Bootcamp between 1st-Nov-2022 and 10th-Jan-2023. These projects cover a range of topics such as basic object oriented programming, exploratory data analysis, SQL databases and Machine learning algorithms.
[Dissertation](https://github.com/ConnerGrice/Geant4-P2P-Investigation) (Report & Code)|My University of York Theoretical Physics BSc dissertation and accompanying code, investigating the optimal detector system for utilising a (p,2p) interaction when determining the proton binding energy within Carbon-12 atoms.
